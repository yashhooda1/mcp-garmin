"""Fitness assessment and pace derivation — the part that makes a plan *yours*.

Everything here is a pure function over the activity dicts that
`list_activities` already returns, so the whole gap-analysis path is testable
offline with no Garmin credentials and no network.

The pipeline a plan generator runs:

    activities  ->  summarize_fitness()  ->  FitnessSnapshot
    snapshot + goal + race date  ->  assess_gap()  ->  GapAssessment
    GapAssessment  ->  plans.marathon / plans.track_hs  ->  TrainingPlan

The honest bit is `assess_gap`: it will tell you the goal doesn't fit in the
weeks you have. A plan generator that quietly ramps someone from 15 to 55 miles
a week in ten weeks isn't ambitious, it's an injury with a calendar attached.
When the gap is too big it returns an achievable goal alongside the requested
one and builds toward the achievable one unless the caller insists.
