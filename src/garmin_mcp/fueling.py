"""Fuelling, hydration and recovery guidance, attached to the plan itself.

Two delivery paths, because a PDF nobody opens is not a nutrition plan:

  1. **Per session** — `fuel_note()` returns a one-line note that plan builders
     append to `WorkoutSpec.description`. Garmin syncs the description to the
     watch and the Connect app, so the fuelling cue is on the wrist at 5am, next
     to the workout it belongs to.
  2. **Per week** — `weekly_brief()` returns a structured block that the MCP
     tools hand back to the assistant alongside the schedule, so "what should I
     eat this week" is answerable from the plan instead of from the internet.

Two audiences, deliberately different:

  * `level="adult"` — ranges from mainstream sports-nutrition practice
    (carbohydrate per hour, protein per kg, the post-run window).
  * `level="hs"` — high-school athletes are minors and still growing. This
    module therefore emits **adequacy-only** guidance for them: eat enough, eat
    often, eat before and after. No calorie targets, no macro maths, no
    body-composition or weight language of any kind, and an explicit pointer to
    a parent, coach, or registered dietitian. Under-fuelling is the single most
    common way a teenage distance runner gets hurt, and a training tool that
    even implies restriction to a 15-year-old is doing harm. If you extend this
    module, keep that invariant.

None of this is medical or dietetic advice. It is general guidance of the kind a
coach gives a squad; individual needs vary, and anyone with a medical condition,
a history of disordered eating, or specific dietary requirements should be
working with a clinician or a registered dietitian rather than a Python module.
