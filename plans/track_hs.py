"""High-school track blocks built toward four classic barrier times:

    800m   sub-2:00
    1600m  sub-4:30
    3200m  sub-10:00
    5K     sub-15:00      (cross-country / road)

Any goal time can be passed; those four are the presets because they are the
marks a high-school distance runner actually organises a season around.

Guardrails, because the athletes here are minors
------------------------------------------------
This module is deliberately more conservative than the marathon generator:

  * **Hard mileage ceilings by event and training age** (`MILEAGE_CEILING`).
    The plan will refuse to ramp past them no matter what goal is requested.
  * **A mandatory full rest day every week.** Sunday is never scheduled.
  * **No doubles, ever.** Two-a-days are a college decision, not a sophomore one.
  * **Quality is capped at two sessions a week**, plus a meet — three hard days
    in a school week is how teenagers get hurt.
  * **Volume holds, never climbs, through a down week or a growth spurt.**
  * Nutrition guidance runs through `fueling` at `level="hs"`, which emits
    adequacy-only advice: eat enough, eat often, no calorie or weight targets.
    Under-fuelling is the most common serious mistake in high-school distance
    running, and this tool will not contribute to it.

This is a template, not a coach. A high-school athlete has an actual coach with
an actual meet schedule and an actual view of that athlete's history — this plan
is something to bring to that coach, not something to run instead of them. Any
pain that changes how you run, or bone pain that hurts when hopping on one leg,
is a stop-and-see-someone signal.
